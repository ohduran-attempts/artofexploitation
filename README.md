# Art of Exploitation

- Hackers get their edge from knowing how all the pieces interact within the bigger picture.

- Thinking of C-source as a program is a common misconception that is exploited by hackers every day. As long as the compiled program works, the average programmer is only concerned with source code. But a hacker realizes that the compiled program is what actually gets executed out in the real world.

## Programming

### firstprog.c & firstprog.txt

The hexadecimal numbers— 100000f40— are memory addresses. Like a row of houses on a local street, memory can be thought of as a row of bytes, each with its own memory address.

The hexadecimal bytes in the middle are the machine language instructions for the processor. The machine code is displayed as bytes and each instruction is put on its own line, like splitting a paragraph into sentences.

The instructions on the far right are in assembly language; a collection of mnemonics for the corresponding machine language instructions. Assembly language instructions have a direct one-to-one relationship with their corresponding machine language instruction; each processor has a different form of assembly language. While you can theoretically create your own x86 assembly language syntax, most people stick with one of the two main types: AT&T syntax and Intel syntax. It’s easy to recognize AT&T syntax by the cacophony of % and $ symbols prefixing everything.
